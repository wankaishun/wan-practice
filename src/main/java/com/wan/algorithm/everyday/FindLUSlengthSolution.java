/**
 *
 * Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.
 *
 * An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.
 *
 * For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).
 *  
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]
 * Output: -1
